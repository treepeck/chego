Game represents a game state that can be converted to or parsed from the PGN
string.

It's the user's responsibility to spin up a time.Ticker and handle time ticks
by calling the [DecrementTime] function.  The value of timeBonus is added to
the player's timer during the [PushMove] function, so the user must ensure that
time ticks and moves are not handled concurrently (prevent race conditions).

NOTE: Call [InitAttackTables] and [InitZobristKeys] ONCE before creating a
[Game].
